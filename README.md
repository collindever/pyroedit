Pyrosphere Pattern Editor 

Online: https://sfranzyshen.github.io/pyroedit/

Offline:
1) Download https://github.com/sfranzyshen/pyroedit/archive/master.zip
2) Extract
3) Open index.html with either firefox or chrome (sorry windows)

It is setup to work with 92 nodes ... the patterns in the folder are converted from the old 91 node files 
This is a top down view with the lower numbers being the lower half of the sphere ... keep in mind that this sphere
(3V) has 6 center axis or 12 points ... and we can map any pattern to any of the 12 points ... so if you make a pattern that goes from bottom to top it will also be played top to bottom and so on
